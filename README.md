Some fun projects I've been working on:


# [Flutter region_detector](https://github.com/Algure/region_detector)
![Screen Recording 2022-09-26 at 03 57 17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37802577/192186634-57c35c21-8f8f-454a-87e1-2584667f4dfb.gif)

Flutter package to listen to user click and drag events over specific regions of your Flutter app. When the pointer enters a region enclosed by a `RegionDetector` widget,
a callback is triggered. A callback is also triggered when the pointer (user finger) leaves the `RegionDetector`.

# [Flutter eazi_grid](https://github.com/Algure/eazigrid)

Easy dynamic Flutter row to list/grid package. Starts out as a row and resizes to a grid - scaling to
dimensions of parent widget.

# [Flutter azstore](https://github.com/Algure/azstore)
Flutter package to access azure storage options via REST APIs.

# [Serving Flutter Web Applications with Flask](https://github.com/Algure/flask_flutter_server)
Repository for article explaining how to setup a Flask application to serve Flutter web builds.
